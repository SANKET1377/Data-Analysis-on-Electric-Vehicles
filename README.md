## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze the dataset on Electric Vehicles to gain insights into their distribution and trends over the years. The analysis will help identify patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Perform **Univariate Analysis** to summarize the distribution of individual variables.
- Conduct **Bivariate Analysis** to explore relationships between two variables.
- The analysis includes generating descriptive statistics and visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

### Task 2: Choropleth Map
- Create a Choropleth map using Plotly Express to display the number of EV vehicles based on location (by state).

### Task 3: Racing Bar Plot
- Develop a Racing Bar Plot to animate the count of Electric Vehicles by Make for each year.
